[17.02.2025] Minor updates that are reported in "Tutorial 8: Supportive Tools for the Experimentation module and creating screenshots"
- Experimentation: Added to tools for the Experimentation module: ConvergencePlotFromXLSX and LatexTableFromXLSX;
- Visualization: Added functionality for requesting plot screenshot creation.

[13.01.2025] Minor updates
- Visualization.plot.PlotModel.updateDataSets (the method allows updating only a selected subset of models)
- Visualization.dataset.AbstractDataSet: _legendLabel field added (equals _name by default, but _legendLabel can be adjusted independently; _name field is reserved to processing)
- Visualization 3D: improved font quality

[07.01.2025] Minor updates + drawing arrows in visualization module
- Added a possibility of drawing arrows (see Tutorial 7: Visualization module -- drawing arrows).
- Added a Simplex class in Utils.space.simplex (provides various functionalities related to a normalized simplex plane (vectors whose components are in [0, 1] bounds and sum up to 1.0).
- Added Visualization.AbstractScheme.setAllFontsTo(String fontName) public method.
- Refactorization: Visualization.dataset.DataSet + added new factory-like classes DSFactory2D and DSFactory3D (they will be updated with new methods from now, not DataSet).
- Refactorization: Minor changes in Utils.space.Vector class and its corresponding VectorTest test.
- Refactorization: Utils.space: Minor changes in IDistance and IScalarizingFunction interfaces (methods informing about preference direction are added).
- Refactorization: Similarity in EvolutionaryComputation.emo.utils.decomposition.similarity.ISimilarity: isLessPreferred changed name to isLessMeaningCloser.
- Refactorization: Resigned from private MyProject and Didactics module; switched to just one "Private".
- Refactorization: Minor changes in packages structure of DecisionSupport.model.constructor.value.
- Refactorization: Minor changes in the evolutionary operators (EvolutionaryComputation.reproduction.operators).
- Bug in Experimentation module: (GlobalDataContainer) The number of threads is reduced to 1 (surpasses the original value) when the empty arguments array is provided to ExperimentPerformer.execute(String [] args). Corrected.
- Bug in Experimentation module: CrossSummarizer throws an exception when the crossed-scenario level is > 3. Corrected.
- Bug in Visualization module: Surpassing legend entry sizes was not working properly. Corrected.
- Changelog.txt is added
