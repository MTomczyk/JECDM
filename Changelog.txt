- Refactorization: Utils.space: Minor changes in IDistance and IScalarizingFunction interfaces (methods informing about preference direction are added)
- Refactorization: Similarity in EvolutionaryComputation.emo.utils.decomposition.similarity.ISimilarity: isLessPreferred changed name to isLessMeaningCloser
- Refactorization: Resigned from private MyProject and Didactics module; switched to just one "Private"
- Refactorization: Minor changes in packages structure of DecisionSupport.model.constructor.value
- Refactorization: Minor changes in the evolutionary operators (EvolutionaryComputation.reproduction.operators)
- Bug in Experimentation module: (GlobalDataContainer) The number of threads is reduced to 1 (surpasses the original value) when the empty arguments array is provided to ExperimentPerformer.execute(String [] args). Corrected.
- Bug in Experimentation module: CrossSummarizer throws an exception when the crossed-scenario level is > 3. Corrected.
