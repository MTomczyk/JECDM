[v1.9.1; 09.01.2026]
- References to the publication on ERS added: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.swevo.2025.102254
- Experimentation: tools.DataSetData.getForDataWithStandardDeviation: there was a bug that caused producing convergence curves with 2x times narrowed envelopes (standard deviations); corrected

[v1.9.0; 10.11.2025]: This update is primarily devoted to the article ``Efficient Preference Learning Algorithm for
Interactive Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimization''. It includes source codes and the data used within this study
(see Projects.y2025.ERS package). Other developments:
- Visualization: Text used in, e.g., axis labels or tick labels, now allows for custom modifications. Currently, only three text modifications are available: italics, superscripts, and subscripts. These modifications can be forced by suitably preparing the text in the LaTeX math mode. Specifically, use $text$ to introduce italics in selected parts of text. Next _ or ^ as a prefix indicating that the following character must be used as subscript or superscript (working with blocks of code is also allowed, e.g., _{text} or ^{text}). Also, combining super/subscripts with italics is available: $_{text}$. Works in 2D and 3D plots.
- Visualization: plot.PlotUtils class is introduced (provides various auxiliary methods; will be further developed in the future)
- Visualization: plot factories (e.g., plot.Plot2DFactory) allow now to provide NumberFormats for tick labels explicitly (can be combined, e.g., with DecimalFormat getDecimalFormat(Character separator, int decimalPlaces) in PlotUtils)
- Visualization: default font 3D quality (upscaling factor) changed to a higher level (2.0->8.0)
- Visualization: utils.Font class is refactored into AbstractFontProcessor and is suitably extended by Font3DProcessor and FontProcessor; should not raise any incompatibility, as this class was not intended to be used directly
- EvolutionaryComputation: problem.moo.zdt; ZDT test bundle added
- EvolutionaryComputation: problem.moo.cw.cw1; an example crash-worthiness test problem added (a case study)
- EvolutionaryComputation: tests dedicated to the EMO package and now correctly set so that they can be executed as test units
- Utils: search.BiSection: simple implementation of the BiSection algorithm added
- Experimentation: indicator:IIndicator gained several default implementations
- Experimentation: tools:LatexTableFromXLSX gained several customization means (see, e.g., IHHLinePreprocessor)
- EvolutionaryComputation: reproduction.AbstractReproduce: createOffspring method gained default implementation (two parents produce one offspring using one obligatory crossover operator and one optional mutation operator)

[v1.8.0; 22.09.2025]: This update introduces several minor updates that are discussed in tutorial documents 14 (new builders), 15 (on the reproduction strategy), 16 (on customizing the normalization process)
- General: several methods and fields became deprecated; please consult their Java docs
- EvolutionaryComputation: pre-configured implementations of the algorithms (e.g., NSGA-II) are provided with dedicated builder objects for constructing their instances (see tutorial 14)
- EvolutionaryComputation: reproduction.ReproductionStrategy class is introduced; it is handled by the EA (IEA.getReproductionStrategy()); it is responsible for keeping auxiliary data dictating the reproduction strategy (e.g., how many offspring are to be generated from one Parents selection); it is employed in various non-API-related components to allow better customization of the processing
- EvolutionaryComputation: selection.Tournament: the instance can now be parameterized with a custom specimen comparator used to determine winners of tournaments
- EvolutionaryComputation: selection.ISelect: selectParents method now can throw a checked exception (should be no compatibility issues unless one explicitly uses this interface)
- EvolutionaryComputation: implementation of MOEA/D; there was a minor bug that caused performing the solution evaluation during initialization two times (impacts only the execution time; not performance in terms of evolution efficiency); fixed
- EvolutionaryComputation: ea.AbstractPhasesEA: the objective space manager was not passed from the method bundle to params container; fixed
- EvolutionaryComputation: os.ObjectiveSpaceManager: the objective space changes listeners are now stored in a list, not an array; and the params container's listeners are considered additional (not a whole new array)
- EvolutionaryComputation: ea.EATimestamp gained the equals and getClone methods
- EvolutionaryComputation: RunningState class introduced; it provides various additional fields and methods related to representing and validating the running state of the algorithm; i.e., checking if two consecutive step() method calls are associated with consistent timestamps
- EvolutionaryComputation: The implementation of NEMO-0 algorithm: the method was not performing correctly if the employed preference model was to be maximized; fixed
- EvolutionaryComputation: the implementation of INormalizationBuilder used by the pre-configured methods to suitably rescale known relevant bounds of the objective space can now be changed (see tutorial 16)
- EvolutionaryComputation: the responsibility of initializing the EA's SpecimensContainer is shifted to AbstractEA.init() from the default ConstructInitialPopulation phase
- EvolutionaryComputation: reproduction.operators.crossover: the crossover-related interfaces gained default implementations, which were consequently removed from the dedicated abstract classes extending these interfaces
- EvolutionaryComputation: A reproduction strategy class (ea.ReproductionStrategy) is introduced to allow for customizing the reproduction mapping (e.g., 2 parents -> 1 offspring; 2 parents -> 2 offspring; 2 parents -> rand(1,2,3) offspring; etc.; see tutorial 15)
- EvolutionaryComputation: reproduction.operators.crossover: additional interfaces/implementations allowing for using different reproduction schemes (e.g., 2 parents -> 2 offspring) are added (see tutorial 15)
- DecisionSupport: dmcontext:DMContext: the context can now be parameterized with a reason for calling the system (see the inner Reason class; one may thus customize further processing based on the reason)
- DecisionSupport: model.constructor.IConstruct: String getName() method added with a default implementation (returns "CONSTRUCTOR")
- DecisionSupport: model.constructor.IConstruct: various methods gained their default implementations, which resulted in removing them from the dedicated AbstractConstructor class
- DecisionSupport: model.constructor.rs.representative.RepresentativeModel migrates to model.constructor.representative.RepresentativeModel and becomes a more generalized class (see the deprecated functionalities)

- Utils: space.normalization.INormalization: static and default cloning-related methods added
- Utils: space.Vector: comparison methods were failing to indicate quality at infinite coordinates (e.g., Double.INFINITY); patched
- Utils: space.os.ObjectiveSpace: the "ObjectiveSpace(double[] utopia, double[] nadir)" constructor now sets the "_criteriaTypes" flags based on the relation of utopia-nadir coordinates (previous implementation: the flags were fixed at "false")
- Utils: space.os.ObjectiveSpace: the "public static ObjectiveSpace getOSMaximallySpanned(boolean[] criteriaTypes)" sets the utopia/nadir positions to Infinity/-Infinity for cost-type criteria (-Infinity/Infinity for the gain-type criteria); the current implementation inverses these values compared to the previous implementation (the direction can be now altered via a parameter)
- EvolutionaryComputation: os.ObjectiveSpace: the "public static ObjectiveSpace getOSMaximallySpanned(boolean[] criteriaTypes)" sets the utopia/nadir positions to Infinity/-Infinity for cost-type criteria (-Infinity/Infinity for the gain-type criteria); the current implementation inverses these values compared to the previous implementation (the direction can be now altered via a parameter)
- Tutorials: GaussianGenerator moved from t1_10.t1_visualization_module.t8_data_updater.shared to Visualization.updater;
- Tutorials: DistanceProcessor renamed to DistanceToMeanProcessor and moved from t1_10.t1_visualization_module.t8_data_updater.shared to Visualization.updater;

[21.08.2025] This update introduces one major update and several minor ones (see below). As for the former, a brief tutorial document is available: "Tutorial 13: Change in the hierarchy of the EA class."
- Major update: the ea.EA class is no longer the highest in the hierarchy; it now implements a dedicated ea.IEA interface that further generalizes the code
- EvolutionaryComputation: reproduction.operators.crossover.ICrossover: the return type of the crossover method changed to a dedicated class that encapsulates the originally implemented output (array)
- EvolutionaryComputation: visualization.updaters.source.EASource: minor changes in this class and the related ones
- EvolutionaryComputation: emo.interactive.iemod.IEMODBundle: an inner params adjuster interface (IParamsAdjuster) is added; it allows dynamically adjusting the configuration of the IEMO/D algorithm when using the dedicated factory-like methods from the IEMOD class
- EvolutionaryComputation: emo.interactive.utils.dmcontext.AbstractDMCParamsConstructor: the processing now allows specifying an implementation of IAlternativesProvider interface, which is responsible for delivering the alternatives superset to the context being built
- Experimentation: executor.ExperimentPerformer: the main folder could have not often been created due to a bug (fixed now)
- Visualization: io.image.ImageUtils class is introduced
- .gitignore file: src/ changed to /src/

[30.06.2025] This update introduces several moderate changes (see below) and includes a new tutorial: "Tutorial 12: A tool for generating reference pairwise comparisons for benchmarking interactive methods."
- Framework: From now on, the library is additionally available as a Jar, which can be downloaded from the project's home page (only the most recent versions will be kept on the server).
- Framework: From now on, the library version number includes the date associated with the push to the repository (e.g., 1.04.30.06.2025; i.e., the last three elements represent the day, month, and year).
- Tutorials: A new tutorial: "Tutorial 12: A tool for generating reference pairwise comparisons for benchmarking interactive methods," was added.
- Libraries: Polyrun library added as a part of this project.
- IMPORTANT: Experimentation: names (getFileSuffix) of several Excel-based results analyzers (e.g., io.cross.excel.FinalStatisticsXLSX) changed (see the source codes).
- Experimentation: io.cross.excel: A few new analyzers added: GenerationRankerXLS (or XLSX) and GenerationStatisticsXLS (or XLSX). They perform similarly to their "Final..." counterparts but concern presenting results attained by the examined methods at specified generations.
- Experimentation: Results analyzers in io.cross: Minor update in processing; the implementations were exhaustively creating new cell styles (CellStyle), even when the styles for different cells were supposed to be the same. It ultimately led to errors when parsing large input data sets. This bug is now fixed.
- DecisionSupport: system.AbstractReport: changes _processingTime from long to double to introduce more precision.
- DecisionSupport: relation.PO: This class represents a relation of potential optimality, and it introduces some basic functionalities.
- DecisionSupport: model.constructor.abstractConstructor.getReport() changed into instantiateReport().

- Visualization: scheme.AbstractScheme.getInstance() method removed (getClone() is now supported only)
- Visualization: GridPlots: This wrapper is now founded on GridBagLayout instead of GridLayout; when instantiating, an implementation of its inner IConstraintsAdjuster interface can be passed via constructor to suitably adjust the layout (e.g., the relative spacing of plots; see the JavaDoc)
- Utils: random.MersenneTwister64: 32 bit version was used instead of 64, corrected
- Utils: random.IRandom: implementations now have the possibility to deploy streams, or advanced versions of the class instance (which may be helpful when parallelizing computations)
- Utils: utils.ArrayUtils class added (the initial version allows for concise creation of arrays ([]))
- Experimentation: container.global.initializers.IRandomNumberGeneratorInitializer: new implementation called FromStreamsInitializer is added; new implementation called DefaultRandomNumberGeneratorInitializer: the class now can be parameterized to deploy RNGs of a desired type
- Experimentation: container.global.initializers.IRandomNumberGeneratorInitializer: new implementation called FromStreamsInitializer is added; new implementation called FromStreamsInitializer is added; it allows for pre-constructing RNG streams, which are then suitably associated with the trials being processed (the constructed RNGs must be splittable or jumpable, see the implementation details)
- Experimentation: minor factorization related to exception throwing/handling
- EvolutionaryComputation: reproduction.operators: Simple generic interfaces for operators are added: ICrossover<T> and IMutate<T> (also, IWeightsReproducer)

[30.04.2025] This update is mainly dedicated to the "ge" tutorial document
- Visualization: line width property can be set via a scheme for 3D components Cube, Axes, and Panes (seek suitable fields, e.g., PANE3D_TOP_LINES_WIDTH).
- Visualization: plot.plotModel.requestScreenshotCreation(...):  option (parameter) for clipping the created screenshot is added; the screenshot is clipped so that its depicted object occupies all the image; it is done by removing the first/last columns/rows whose all pixels match the given color.
- Visualization: minor fixes linked to arrow rendering
- Visualization: Plot3D.getModel(): auxiliary method for adjusting plot projection added (updateProjectionTranslation, updateCameraRotation, updatePlotrRotation)
- EvolutionaryComputation: New Evolutionary Rejection Sampling (ERS) method added (see the tutorial)
- EvolutionaryComputation: visualization.utils.getFlat2DPF (and similar) methods added (construct flat, normalized reference Pareto fronts).
- EvolutionaryComputation: problem.moo.ReferencePointsFactory: getUniformRandomRPsOnConcaveSphere(...) method (and similar) added; they allow for constructing reference points that are sampled uniformly on convex/concave spheres
- EvolutionaryComputation: reproduction.operators.crossover.OnSimplexCombination and reproduction.operators.mutation.OnSimplexMutation added
- EvolutionaryComputation: ObjectiveSpaceManager gained a mode: _deriveNadirFromVectorsFormingUtopia (nadir is built from objective vectors forming the utopia)
- EvolutionaryComputation: utils.GenerationsLimits: an auxiliary class that allows for concisely determining generations limits for various problems is added
- EvolutionaryComputation: utils.ReferencePointsOnParetoFront: an auxiliary class that allows for concisely creating and wrapping Pareto optimal reference points (generated randomly)
- EvolutionaryComputation: interactive: the primary algorithm classes (e.g., IEMOD) were extended with new static methods for instantiating the algorithms.
- EvolutionaryComputation: the primary algorithm classes (e.g., NSGA-II, IEMO/D, etc.): now the methods are instantiated with a fixed ObjectiveSpaceManager if they are to run without dynamically updating the OS bounds (previously, the manager was set to null); the manager will not be instantiated if the MOO problem and its utopia and nadir points are not delivered
- Utils: statistics.Min/Max/Mean/StandardDeviationIgnoreNegatives added
- Experimentation: tools.LatexTableFromXLSX: cell pre and postprocessing option added
- Experimentation: io.scenario: TrialsResultsXLSX summarizer added; it fills data matrix by explicitly copying results from the trial level without performing the summary (the resulting matrices are of generations x trials size; per indicator)
- DecisionSupport: model.similarity.ISimilarity added (concept of similarity between internal models is added along with example implementations)
- DecisionSupport: model.constructor.value.rs.ers.ERS added (Evolutionary Rejection Sampling)
- DecisionSupport: model.constructor.value.rs.ers.ERS and ..frs.FRS: both extend AbstractRejectionSampling class
- DecisionSupport: model.constructor.value.rs.ers.ERS and ..frs.FRS: iterations limit of both can be flexibly adjusted by implementing IIterationLimit and providing via Params container

[18.03.2025] Moderate changes. Some of them are described in "Tutorial 9: Facilitating the usage"
- Experimentation: Experimentation: container.global.initializers.IRandomNumberGeneratorInitializer: The method's signature changed. Now, it comprises data on the calling scenario and trial. This way, a non-colliding seed may be derived without using the counter (based on the scenario ID, trial ID, and the total number of trials; see the DefaultRandomNumberGeneratorInitializer class), and it will be calculated as if no scenario/trial was disabled. Disabling, e.g., trials, would make RNGs be appointed seeds that are "flushed to the left" in the previous approach. Hence, repeating the execution of selected trials would generate colliding seeds across multiple executions of the experiment executor. Now, this issue will not arise unless the top-level fields, such as scenario definitions, are altered (it is preferred to use scenario/trial disabling conditions to adjust the experimental setup).
- Visualization: color.palette: classes related to modeling color palettes are introduced. They will be further
developed in the future.
- Visualization: updater.DataPointsProcessor is added. It works similarly to the regular DataProcessor class, but
allows performing per-points (data points) manipulations via an auxiliary object implementing a dedicated interface
(see the class description)
- Visualization: drmanager.DRMPFactory class added (display ranges manager params factory). It provides various static methods for initializing the params container for the display ranges manager.
- Visualization: plot.Plot2DFactory, PCP2DFactory, Heatmap2DFactory, Heatmap3DFactory classes added. They support quickly initializing the plot objects.
- EvolutionaryComputation: reproduction.valuecheck.IValueCheck, reproduction.operators.crossover.ICrossover, reproduction.operators.mutation.IMutate return types of the interface methods changed from void to their corresponding input types (e.g., input = int, return = int), and it is assumed that the returned objects are the input vectors. This change allows for combining the execution of different operators (nested method calls).
- EvolutionaryComputation: phases.PhasesBundle.copyPhasesFromBundleToEA: changed signature (order of inputs changed).
- EvolutionaryComputation: population.Specimen: setters for decision vectors were removed.
- EvolutionaryComputation: emo.aposteriori: the default "_updateUtopiaUsingIncumbent" flags were switched to false.
- EvolutionaryComputation: visualization.utils.ReferenceParetoFront added. This class provides means for instantiating data sets (for the visualization) portraying some common Pareto fronts. This class will be further developed in the future.
- EvolutionaryComputation: phase.DoubleConstruct, DoubleEvaluate, reproduction.DoubleReproduce (similarly to Double: Int, Bool, and Chromosome. These are new implementations of the IConstruct, IEvaluate, and IReproduce interfaces. They delegate the individual, i.e., per-specimen tasks (i.e., evaluate a specimen), to auxiliary objects implementing straightforward interfaces (inner interfaces). These auxiliary objects can be supplied when instantiating the DoubleConstruct, etc., to allow quick definition (inline) of the process (e.g., evaluation rules).
- EvolutionaryComputation: emo.aposteriori and interactive: the primary algorithm classes (e.g., NSGA) were extended with new static methods for instantiating the methods.
- EvolutionaryComputation: emo.aposteriori and interactive: the primary algorithm classes (e.g., NSGA): the default parents selection policy was unified and set to Random.
- Utils: a simple utils.The MathUtils class has been added and will be developed in the future. The intention is to use the framework's implementations of mathematical functions, thus minimizing the use of external libraries (e.g., Commons Math).
