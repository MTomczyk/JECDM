This problem bundle represents the Crash-worthiness problem (Liao, X., Li, Q., Yang, X. et al. Multiobjective
optimization for crash safety design of vehicles using stepwise regression model. Struct Multidisc Optim 35, 561–569
(2008). <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00158-007-0163-x">.LINK</a>). Note that the problem assumes that there are
5 continuous decision variables in [1;3] bounds. This bundle's implementation assumes using normalized variables in
[0; 1] bounds. A suitable linear rescaling is done when evaluating the solutions.
