This is a bundle of supplementary data delivered with the article
``Interactive tool for visualizing the comprehensive performance of evolutionary multi-objective algorithms applied to
problems with two or three objectives''
published in the GECCO 2024 conference materials. It consists of (the supplementary materia):
- the visualization tool IVEMO_HM.jar,
- series of data linked to different cases discussed in the article; these are kept in different ``case'' folders,
- folder containing video files showing the use of the tool
Note that the tool requires the init and binary files to be in the same folder as the tool's location.
Copy and paste them from case-folders before running IVEMO_HM.jar.

As for the codes included in this package, one can run the visualization tool
for different cases presented in the abovementioned article via the ExternalLoader
class. Different cases can be run by suitably adjusting the path provided as
the main argument.

The following keyboard/mouse layout is used when run in 3D mode:
- 'w': move the camera forward,
- 'b': move the camera backward,
- 'l': move the camera left,
- 'd': move the camera right,
- 'q': move the camera down,
- 'e': move the camera up,
- 'r': reset projection,
- mouse left button dragging: rotate the camera,
- mouse right button dragging: rotate the heatmap.
