# Java framework for Evolutionary Computation and Decision Making

Java framework for Evolutionary Computation and Decision Making (JECDM) is a computational framework written in Java that primarily intends to facilitate research on preference-based evolutionary multi-objective optimization. The project's homepage is https://www.jecdm.cs.put.poznan.pl/, where one may find its overview and various tutorials discussing how to utilize it in practice.<br>

JECDM is licensed under the MIT License. <br>

**Important note**: The software is free to use, but one uses it at their own risk. Furthermore, JECDM utilizes a few free third-party libraries. These can be found in the "libs" folder, along with their license notes.

**How to acknowledge the project?** Since JECDM is primarily for research, appropriate credit can be a citation. As for the initial release of JECDM, one can cite, e.g., a document that overviews JECDM in the following way:<br>
