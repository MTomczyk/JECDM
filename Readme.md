# Java framework for Evolutionary Computation and Decision Making

Java framework for Evolutionary Computation and Decision Making (JECDM) is a computational framework written in Java that primarily intends to facilitate research on preference-based evolutionary multi-objective optimization. The project's homepage is https://www.jecdm.cs.put.poznan.pl/, where one may find its overview and various tutorials discussing how to utilize it in practice.<br>

JECDM is licensed under the MIT License. <br>

**Important note**: The software is free to use, but one uses it at their own risk. Furthermore, JECDM utilizes a few free third-party libraries. These can be found in the "libs" folder, along with their license notes.

**How to acknowledge the project?** Since JECDM is primarily for research, appropriate credit can be a citation. As for the initial release of JECDM, one can cite, e.g., a document that overviews JECDM in the following way:<br>

**Note that**, however, a peer-reviewed publication showcasing JECDM is planned to be published soon. When issued, it is suggested to cite that future work (this paragraph will be accordingly updated in the future). When using JECDM for commercial purposes, appropriate credit should also be given.
