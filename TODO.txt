This document contains loose ideas on future updates:

Decision Support:
- For the preference elicitation: allow the DM(s) to resign from providing feedback (after reference sets are shown).

Evolutionary Computation:
- Introducing the archive functionality (SpecimenContainer).
- Multiple RNGs for possible in-EA multithreading (each thread should have a different generator)
- Simple EA for generic regression.

Visualization:
- Upsampling (rendering in higher DPI)
- Interface for overwriting scheme after plot is initialized (to avoid the manual update, e.g., in plot 3d).
- Allowing for changing some of the data sets, while keeping the others untouched (i.e., using static and dynamic data sets).
- Data set that aggregates multiple data sets (for preloading, wrapped data sets can be turned off/on for rendering)
- Providing better ways of ticks (axis) adjustment.
- Creating custom legend (legend entries)
- Using multiple colorbars
- Using multiple X, Y axes
- Introducing OpenGL-based 2D rendering mode.
- Allowing marker edges to have a volume (e.g., Line.POLY_OCTO).
- Introducing lighting into 3D mode and custom objects loading.
- Introducing textures into 3D mode.
- Introducing clipping into 3D mode.
- Improving text quality in 3D mode.
- On plot annotations
- Introducing labels (data sets) to into 2D/3D mode
- Marker size based on attribute value (use of DR)
- Heatmap2D: providing values in buckets
- Providing initial projection data as an input (for 3D)
- New data sets: arrows and labels

Experimentation
- Mechanisms for surpassing original names of the indicators
- Option for automatically saving the summary in txt
