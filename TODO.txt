This document contains loose ideas on future updates:

Decision Support:
- For the preference elicitation: allow the DM(s) to resign from providing feedback (after reference sets are shown).
- ERS method: reporting the success rate on inserting models built into the queue
- ERS/FRS methods: interface for notifications on the success/failure in generating a compatible model (ERS: in inserting into the queue)

Evolutionary Computation:
- Let Specimen have a reference to its Parents; IMPORTANT: It may cause serious memory leaks as the reference to past specimens will not be lost (Specimen->Parents->Specimen->Parents->etc.). Thus, setting this field should be somewhat controlled with the possibility to clear data on past specimens (clear references); note that the Parents object should therefore be cloned
- Introducing the archive functionality (SpecimenContainer).
- Phases: allow providing custom pre-post actions (simple one-method interfaces; lambda methods; stacked on the list or passed via arrays)
- Phases: simple customizable phase; passing own implementations via list to instantiate EA's processing
- Simple EA for generic regression.

Visualization:
- Upsampling (rendering in higher DPI)
- Interface for overwriting scheme after plot is initialized (to avoid the manual update, e.g., in plot 3d).
- Allowing for changing some of the data sets, while keeping the others untouched (i.e., using static and dynamic data sets).
- Data set that aggregates multiple data sets (for preloading, wrapped data sets can be turned off/on for rendering).
- Providing better ways of ticks (axis) adjustment.
- Creating custom legend (legend entries).
- Using multiple colorbars.
- Using multiple X, Y axes (aux X, Y axes + anchored X, Y axes, i.e., located at specific coordinates).
- Introducing OpenGL-based 2D rendering mode.
- Allowing marker edges to have a volume (e.g., Line.POLY_OCTO).
- Introducing lighting into 3D mode and custom objects loading.
- Introducing textures into 3D mode.
- Introducing clipping into 3D mode.
- Improving text quality in 3D mode.
- On plot annotations.
- Introducing labels (data sets) to into 2D/3D mode.
- Marker size based on attribute value (use of DR).
- Heatmap2D: providing values in buckets
- Providing initial projection data as an input (for 3D; interface (lambda))
- New data sets: rectangles, etc.
- Allow for rendering the fonts in Latex (+ math mode, etc.).
- Interface (lambda) for custom post (at the top) or pre drawing (the drawing context is passed).

Experimentation
- Mechanisms for surpassing original names of the indicators
- Option for automatically saving the summary in txt
- Customizing the monitor thread logs + logging performance measurement time
